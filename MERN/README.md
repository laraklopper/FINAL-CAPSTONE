## SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

The intended webstack used for developing the application is create react app, together with Express, Node and MongoDB.

To style the system CSS styling sheets will because although this may take longer the code is written in a separate document and therefore the code easier to read and less complicated than other methods such as inline styling.

The application will deployed on netlify because it is a free site with good services.

In summary the webstack is MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, otherwise known as MERN stack, the application will be styled on separate CSS document(s) and will be deployed using Netlify.
